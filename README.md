Our project focuses on helping mentally ill children by building a simple and user-friendly platform for teachers and caregivers. During our field visit to special schools, 
we saw how difficult it is to track the growth of these children using only charts and sketches. So, we decided to create a system that calculates IQ from test marks and shows the child’s improvement over time.
We used HTML, CSS, and Python with Django to make the platform. 
Teachers can log in, upload marks, and the system will automatically calculate IQ and show reports. This helps teachers understand each child’s learning ability better. 
The platform also tracks attendance, progress, and stores all data safely using MySQL.
We added visual elements and kept the design very simple so even non-technical users can use it easily. 
We also thought about safety, so every login is secure. In the future, we plan to include video tutorials and fun puzzles to make learning more enjoyable.
Through this project, we realized how technology can be used to support special education. 
We believe this system will reduce the manual effort of teachers and give special children better opportunities to grow. It was a meaningful and emotional journey for our whole team.
